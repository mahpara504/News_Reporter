                    The rest of Europe have been warned - Real Madrid are back.

                    And back as the stadium-filling rock legends that we know them to be, as opposed to the enthusiastic, discordant high school band they have looked like for so much of the season.
                    
                    Carlo Ancelotti's beat Brest 3-0 on Wednesday in the final match of the Champions League league phase and will now face either Manchester City or Celtic in a mouth-watering play-off.
                    
                    Since being destroyed 5-2 by Barcelona in the Spanish Super Cup, Real have won their past five matches, scoring 20 goals, and are top of La Liga by four points.
                    
                    An indifferent start to the campaign, including some inconsistent form and questions around the dynamic of the side with new superstar signing Kylian Mbappe, saw plenty of criticism directed towards boss Ancelotti.
                    
                    "Ancelotti is leaving the club in the summer", "Mbappe can't settle", "Vinicius Jr is unsettled" - people were asking what was going on at Real.
                    
                    But the demise of the European giants has been exaggerated.
                    
                    Ancelotti has never been unduly bothered by the opinions of people outside of the club, although this time he sensed there were elements emanating from within.

                    When one Spanish radio announced Ancelotti had told the club this season would be his last, they jumped the gun and he wasted no time in issuing a swift denial.

But Ancelotti will be the one to decide when he leaves the club, despite the year and a half left in his contract. After four years and 11 trophies - including two Champions League successes - he has earned the right to.

It also explains his slight smugness when informing the media that, after stating they were no good at all, their current league performances suggest the critics were wrong.

What is certain is that no-one is better placed than him to know when the time is right to walk away - and that will be when he believes he can no longer find the necessary solutions to ensure the continual arrival of trophies at the club.

At that point he will allow Florentino Perez to prepare the way for a new arrival - more likely than not Xabi Alonso, who always thought that Real or Liverpool would be his next steps if things went well with Bayer Leverkusen.

But not just yet.

Ancelotti has always believed Real would win titles this season, especially if they managed to overcome the inherent laziness that can often follow on from a Champions League and La Liga winning campaign.

It's worth noting that they still haven't beaten any of the top sides this season, including defeats by AC Milan and Liverpool in the Champions League and having nine thumped past them in their two encounters against Barcelona.

Ancelotti, though, remains unwavering in his belief.
