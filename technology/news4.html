                    Our hands perform thousands of complex tasks every day – can artificial intelligence help robots match these extraordinary human appendages?

The human hand is one of the most staggeringly sophisticated and physiologically intricate parts of the body. It has more than 30 muscles, 27 joints alongside a network of ligaments and tendons that give it 27 degrees of freedom. There are more than 17,000 touch receptors and nerve endings in the palm alone. These features allow our hands to perform a dazzling array of highly complex tasks through a broad range of different movements.   

But you don't need to tell any of that to Sarah de Lagarde.   

In August 2022, she was on top of the world. She had just climbed Mount Kilimanjaro with her husband and was supremely fit. But just one month later, she found herself lying in a hospital bed, with horrific injuries.  

While returning home from work, De Lagarde slipped and fell between a tube train and the platform at High Barnet station in London. Crushed by the departing train and another that then came into the station, she lost her right arm below the shoulder and part of her right leg.  

After the long healing process, she was offered a prosthetic arm by the UK's National Health Service, but it offered her little in terms of normal hand movement. Instead, it seemed to prioritise form over functionality. 

"It doesn't really look like a real arm," she says. "It was deemed creepy by my children." 

The prosthetic only featured a single joint at the elbow while the hand itself was a static mass on the end. For nine months she struggled to perform the daily tasks she had previously taken for granted, but then was offered something transformational – a battery-powered bionic arm utilising artificial intelligence (AI) to anticipate the movements she wants by detecting tiny electrical signals from her muscles. 

"Every time I make a movement it learns," De Lagarde says. "The machine learns to recognise the patterns and eventually it turns into generative AI, where it starts predicting what my next move is." 

Even picking up something as simple as a pen, and fiddling it in our fingers to adopt a writing position involves seamless integration between body and brain. Hand-based tasks that we perform with barely a thought require a refined combination of both motor control and sensory feedback – from opening a door to playing a piano. 

With this level of complexity, it's no wonder that attempts to match the versatility and dexterity of human hands have evaded medical professionals and engineers alike for centuries. From the rudimentary spring-loaded iron hand of a 16th-Century German knight to the world's first robotic hand with sensory feedback created in 1960s Yugoslavia, nothing has come close to matching the natural abilities of the human hand. Until now.  

Advances in AI are ushering in a generation of machines that are getting close to matching human dexterity. Intelligent prostheses, like the one De Lagarde received, can anticipate and refine movement. Soft-fruit picking bots can pluck a strawberry in a field and place it delicately in a punnet of other berries without squishing them. Vision-guided robots can even carefully extract nuclear waste from reactors. But can they really ever compete with the amazing capabilities of the human hand?  

Embodied AI  
I recently gave birth to my first child. Within moments of entering the world, my daughter's small hand wrapped softly around my partner's forefinger. Unable to focus her eyes on anything more than a few inches in front of her, her hand and arm movements are limited, on the whole, to involuntary reflexes that allow her to grip an object when it is placed in her palm. It is an adorable illustration of the sensitivity of our dexterity, even in our earliest moments – and hints at how much it improves as we mature.  

Over the coming months, my daughter's vision will progress enough to give her depth perception, while the motor cortex of her brain will develop, giving her increasing control over her limbs. Her involuntary grasps will give way to more deliberate grabbing actions, her hands feeding signals back to her brain, allowing her to make fine adjustments in movement as she feels and explores the world around her. It will take my daughter several years of determined effort, trial, error and play to attain the level of hand dexterity that adults possess.
