                    On the night of the 1998 NBA draft, the Dallas Mavericks used the sixth pick on a player who seemed poised to usher them into the future: Robert “Tractor” Traylor, a power forward out of Michigan. Listed at 6-foot-8 and 280 pounds, the lumbering Traylor was supposed to bring size and toughness to a Mavs roster in desperate need of both. 

Except that wasn’t what happened. Three picks later, the prospect the Mavericks front office truly coveted was scooped up by the Bucks: Dirk Nowitzki, a 7-foot-tall, sweet-shooting 20-year-old from Würzburg, Germany. His selection was greeted with boos in General Motors Place in Vancouver, perhaps owing to his relative anonymity or to the bias held by some NBA fans that European players were soft and slow.

Later that night, the Mavericks and Bucks announced that they were swapping Traylor and Nowitzki, with Milwaukee throwing in no. 19 pick Pat Garrity to sweeten the deal. Nowitzki wasn’t received any more warmly in Texas. 

“Good grief. There isn’t going to be one player in the country who could help this awful team,” read a column in the Fort Worth Star-Telegram. “Europeans are such a risky bet, especially in the lottery. So many bust. So few bloom,” read an analysis of Nowitzki in the Houston Chronicle. The writer of that latter piece gave the Mavs’ draft a failing grade. 

The negativity was understandable: The Mavericks had recently squandered what seemed to be the promising trio of Jason Kidd, Jamal Mashburn, and Jimmy Jackson, and at the time they hadn’t made the playoffs in nearly a decade. After they left Dallas, Kidd had immediately gone on to become an All-Star in Phoenix, and Mashburn had quickly emerged as a key contributor for a championship contender in Miami. 

The Mavericks, meanwhile, were in the midst of a slide in which they’d won more than 28 games just once in a span of eight seasons. They were firmly ensconced among the dregs of the league, trapped near the bottom of the standings alongside the Clippers, Nuggets, Raptors, and Grizzlies. Although the Mavs were under new management—founding owner Don Carter had sold the team in 1996, and Don Nelson had joined as general manager in ’97—there was little evidence that the new-look front office knew what it was doing. 

Taking Nowitzki, who was openly toying with the idea of staying in Europe for a few more years, appeared to be further proof that the Mavs weren’t committed to winning, or at least didn’t know how. Little did anyone know that Nowitzki’s arrival was the start of the reinvention of a franchise that had long been overshadowed by the Cowboys locally and by the Rockets and Spurs among NBA fans in Texas. 

Nowitzki and Steve Nash, Nelson and Michael Finley, and Mark Cuban and Rick Carlisle stoked a basketball love affair in Dallas that lasted for more than 20 years. When the franchise landed Luka Doncic in a 2018 draft day trade with the Hawks, history seemed to repeat itself, and Dallas appeared destined to thrive for at least another decade. Doncic’s first season in Dallas was Nowitzki’s last, an almost too perfect passing of the baton from the Mavericks’ retiring hero to their ascendant one. The team finished last in the division that year, but no one seemed to mind because Doncic was named Rookie of the Year and confirmed that he was up to the challenge of inheriting face-of-the-franchise status from Nowitzki.

After Luka led the Mavs to the 2019 playoffs in his sophomore season, Dallas fans took for granted that they’d have an entertaining, contending team for years to come. And why wouldn’t they? Doncic certainly wasn’t going anywhere; he loved Dallas, and Dallas loved him back. What a gift in the topsy-turvy NBA, where many superstars start looking toward the horizon—and for big-name reinforcements—during the lean years. 

“To be honest, Luka was created in a lab to engender the most love and support and emotion in a fan base ever—and they just dropped that in Dallas,” says Jake Kemp, a longtime Dallas sports media personality who cohosts a Dallas sports podcast and writes a Substack called The Dumb Zone. “He was a one of one.” 

The love affair came to an excruciating end on February 2, when the Mavericks completed the most astonishing trade in NBA history. Dallas sent Doncic to the Los Angeles Lakers in exchange for Anthony Davis, Max Christie, and a 2029 first-round draft pick. Dealing Doncic to a hated Western Conference rival—a franchise that some Dallas sports fans despise more than any not named the Philadelphia Eagles or San Francisco 49ers—was a betrayal of an unspoken promise forged in the futility of the 1990s.
