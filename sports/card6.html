                    The family of boxer John Cooney, who died following a title fight in Belfast, have described him as their "champion", who was full of energy, laughter and love.

                    The 28-year-old from Galway, died a week after suffering an injury in the clash in defence of his Celtic super-featherweight title in the city.
                    
                    His death was announced in a statement published by his promoter, Mark Dunlop, on behalf of the Cooney family and his fianc√©e, Emmaleen.
                    
                    He had been treated at Belfast's Royal Victoria Hospital for an intracranial haemorrhage, also known as a bleed on the brain, following his defeat to Welshman Nathan Howells at the Ulster Hall on 1 February.
                    
                    Hundreds of people attended the funeral mass in Galway, including John's parents, Hughie and Tina, Emmaleen and his brothers Conor and Aaron, at the Church of St John the Apostle in Knocknacarra.
                    
                    An Irish tricolour was draped over the coffin along with a picture of the boxer, while floral tributes were left around the altar.

                    Boxer John Cooney died last weekend following a fight the previous week
                    'We will keep your spirit alive'
                    
                    Fr Tadhg Quinn told mourners that the family donated some of Mr Cooney's organs to five different people, and in doing so, gave them "a greater chance of living".
                    
                    Speaking on behalf of his parents, Hughie and Tina, his aunt Georgina Ivors said: "We loved every minute of raising you to be the most amazing man that you became.
                    
                    "Son, you went on to achieve more than we could have ever dreamed of, and we couldn't be prouder, but the greatest achievement of all was meeting your soul mate, Emmaleen.
                    
                    "There couldn't have been a more perfect match for you and our family. She will always be a part of our family, and we will continue to love and support her.
                    
                    "We take great comfort that you went on to save many lives, and in your memory, we will be an advocate for organ donation.
                    
                    
                    
                    "As a family, we are truly touched by the kindness and compassion that was shown to us from people all over.
                    
                    "As a family, we will miss you, but we will keep your spirit alive, and your stories told. Our lives will never be the same without you, John, we will always love you and forever be very proud."
                    
                    Emmaleen sang the Sarah McLachlan song - In The Arms Of An Angel.
                    
                    Speaking after, Fr Quinn said Mr Cooney would have been so proud of her.
                    
                    "To lay to rest the soul mate that you loved and put so much work into for the past five years, to lay to rest on Valentine's Day makes it so hard," he added.
