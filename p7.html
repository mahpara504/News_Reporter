                    French President Emmanuel Macron has toured Paris's Notre-Dame cathedral live on TV, giving the public a first look inside the building since much of it was destroyed or damaged in a huge fire in 2019.

From the spire to the stained glass, it has been completely transformed. It is not just a renovation after the fire, but a complete overhaul including removing decades of crud and soot built up since the last restoration.

Here we take a look at some of the key features of the repair work and how it was achieved. The collapse of the spire was the climax of the 2019 fire. Many people thought it was medieval, but in fact the original was taken down in the 1790s because it was deemed dangerous.

Its replacement, which burned down five years ago, was put up decades later as part of a neo-Gothic reconstruction conducted by architect Eug√®ne Viollet-Le-Duc.

This time, carpenters used a mix of the traditional and the computerised to design and build the massive wooden base.

It was lifted into place by Europe's largest crane, then a scaffolding shell was mounted allowing workers to assemble the steadily rising structure.

Like the rest of the roof, the spire is lined with lead. At the top a new gilded cock has been fitted to replace the original that fell in the fire. It was recovered but was too damaged to go back.

Inside the new cock are holy relics including a thorn from the cathedral's Crown of Thorns, and a parchment with the names of 2,000 people who worked on the renovation. The most striking feature of the renovated cathedral is the luminosity of the stonework. This is because all the limestone blocks have been cleaned, or in some parts replaced.

Replacement stone was sourced in quarries in northern France. Experts were able to detect tiny features in the original stone - like certain fossils - that helped them to determine the geographical origin.

The vast majority of the masonry was undamaged, but it was covered not just in age-old accretions of dust and dirt from the past, but also in a layer of soot and lead powder from the fire. It was cleaned with high-power vacuums, and then with a spray which peeled off to remove the dirt.

Overall some 40,000 square metres of stone were cleaned.

To rebuild the vaulted ceiling beneath where the spire had stood, masons had to relearn the principles of Gothic architecture - using a wooden frame to put the stones in place and crowning it all with the keystone.
