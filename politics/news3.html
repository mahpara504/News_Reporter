                    After a bumper year of elections which saw north-east England as a key battleground, what does 2025 hold for our region's political scene?

With a new North East mayor and pivotal general election results, many are getting used to a new status quo.

Some politicians across the spectrum of parties will be hoping for a more successful year, while others will want to hold on to positive momentum.

More elections
You'd be forgiven for expecting a year off elections after the busy year gone by, but the local elections cycle goes on - and it's a big year for two councils.

Northumberland and Durham are set for their all-out elections, as, unlike most councils in the North East which elect some councillors on rotation every year, voters elect all three of their individual councillors at once.

It means there's potential for dramatic changes in power, with every single councillor's job up for grabs in the same night, and if one party really nails it, they'll take control for the next four years.

The Conservatives are hoping to hold on to control in Northumberland.

Councillor Guy Renner-Thompson spent time last year campaigning as his party's candidate for North East Mayor.

Even after losing that election, he was optimistic about the Tories' chances in the council.

He told BBC Radio Newcastle: "Really, the talk is about the government.

"The mood is very negative and people are looking for some opposition to things that Labour have brought in that they didn't expect them to.

"We'll be fighting with our own positive message, but we're not complacent in any way."

In Durham, the Liberal Democrats are seeking to defend their own leadership.

Councillor Amanda Hopgood took over as leader of the council by forming a coalition with other opposition parties when Labour failed to return a majority in 2021.

She's promised residents that, despite the looming election, the council coalition would still work across party lines to serve residents.

"It is still business as usual. We have a council to run, we have a budget to pass, services to deliver and ambitions to fulfil.

"I think May will throw up some surprises... I am optimistic because that opportunity is there for us to do well again."

As for Labour, it's looking to defend North Tyneside, where voters will be choosing their mayor.

Another mayor?! Not to be confused with Kim McGuinness, the metropolitan mayor for the whole of the North East, the North Tyneside mayor is simply an elected leader of their individual council, acting underneath the combined authority.

The current North Tyneside Mayor, Dame Norma Redfearn, announced plans to step down after three successive terms in charge of the council.

Now Labour will be hoping it can hold onto power without the advantage of incumbency.

But will national issues foil Labour's local hopes?

Cramlington and Killingworth MP Emma Foody told the BBC: "I'm not going to say we haven't had a difficult six months.

"But what we saw with the last government was a government that was willing to make short term decisions not in the interests of the country.

"This government is a government willing to take short term unpopularity to make long term decisions in the interests of our country and our local communities."
